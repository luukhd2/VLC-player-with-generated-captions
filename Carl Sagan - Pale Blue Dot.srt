1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
From this distant vantage point, the earth might not seem of any particular interest.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
But for us, it's different.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Consider again that dot.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
That's here.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
That's home.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
That's us.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
On it, everyone you love, everyone you know,

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
everyone you ever heard of,

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
every human being who ever was,

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
lived out their lives.

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
The aggregate or joy and suffering.

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Thousands of confident religions, ideologies, and economic doctrines.

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Every hunter and forger, every hero and coward,

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
every creator and destroyer of civilization.

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Every king and peasant, every young couple in love,

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
every mother and father, hopeful child,

17
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
inventor and explorer,

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician,

19
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
every superstar, every supreme leader,

20
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
every saint and sinner in the history of our species,

21
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:12,000
lived there on the mode of dust, suspended in a sunbeam.

22
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
The earth is a very small stage,

23
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
in a fast cosmic arena.

24
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Think of the rivers of blood,

25
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
spilled by all those generals and emperors.

26
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
So that in glory and triumph,

27
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,000
they could become the momentary masters of a fraction of a dot.

28
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Think of the endless cruelty's visited,

29
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
by the inhabitants of one corner of the pixel,

30
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
on the scared-sleeved distinct wishable inhabitants,

31
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
but some other corner,

32
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
how frequent their misunderstandings,

33
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
how eager they are to kill one another,

34
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
how fervent their hatred.

35
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Our pastures,

36
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
our imagines of importance,

37
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
the delusion we have some privilege to position in universe,

38
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,000
are challenged by this point of pale light.

39
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Our planet is a lonely spec in the great enveloping cosmic dark.

40
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,000
In our obscurity, in all this vastness,

41
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
there is no hint that help who come from elsewhere,

42
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
to save us from ourselves.

43
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
The earth is the only world known so far to harbor life.

44
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
There is nowhere else, at least in the near future,

45
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
to which our species could migrate.

46
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Visit, yes,

47
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
settle,

48
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
not yet.

49
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Like it or not,

50
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
for the moment, the earth is where we make our stand.

51
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
It has been said that astronomy is a humbling

52
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
and character building experience.

53
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,000
There is perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of new inconsists,

54
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
than this distant image of our tiny world.

55
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
To me,

56
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:16,000
it underscores our responsibility to deal more kindly with one another,

57
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
and to preserve and cherish the pale blue dot.

58
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
The only one we've ever known.
